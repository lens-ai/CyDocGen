## Setting Sector via Repository Variables

1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Navigate to Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
3. Click on "Variables" tab
4. Add new repository variable:
   - Name: `SECTOR`
   - Value: `healthcare` (or `financial`, `automotive`, etc.)

This will apply to all workflow runs automatically without needing to modify the workflow file.

## Environment Variable Priority

The system checks for sector configuration in this order:
1. Repository variable `SECTOR` 
2. Environment variable in workflow
3. Default to `healthcare` if not specified

## Validation

The system validates the sector value and will default to `healthcare` with a warning if an invalid sector is provided. Valid sectors are:
- healthcare
- financial
- automotive
- aerospace
- industrial
